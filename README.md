Remember, the fact that you can think, the fact that you can read this, the fact that you can learn and understand - all of this give you the ability to improve and achieve your goals. It's important to appreciate that not everyone is as lucky as you!

-Learning to code is a bit like going to the gym. First, it requires a lot of motivation to start. Next, develop it as a habit by continuously carrying out the task daily for a month.
-Code for a purpose. Think up a simple app or website that you want to make.
-There is no perfect language to learn.
-Understand what you're writing. You don't need more recipes, you need to learn to cook without them.
-It's ok to not know. Nobody can hold all the relevant information in their head. The skill that most employers look for is the ability to think. Find resources to help you solve your issues.
-Be a Copycat.
-Be Accountable. Just as you’re more likely to go to the gym if you
sign up with your partner, you’re more likely to learn if you
have a coding buddy.
-Keep learning. If you need change, learn to use a new tool.
